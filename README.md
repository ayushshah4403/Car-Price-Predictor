# Car-Price-Predictor
The Car Price Prediction project uses machine learning techniques to predict the prices of cars based on various features such as make, model, year, and mileage. The model is trained on a large dataset of car information and can accurately predict prices for new car listings. It can be useful for car buyers, sellers, and dealers to make informed decisions about pricing and market trends.
